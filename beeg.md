## Part 1:
This challenge is an implementation of RSA with a very small exponent. Because of the information given and the mishandled encryption, we can skip standard decryption and just take the cube root of the ciphertext. Then, we can crunch this data from bytes back into hex.

Admittedly I didn't fully understand this challenge, as I had to leave early b/c of another meeting. I plan to update this writeup after completing the second half of the challenge later this week (hopefully).
