# Youre up - OSINT
----

Part 1:
We are given a photo of a mural and told that someone is discussing the Catherdral across the street. Using google lens on the photo yields an address, which we can use to get the location of the Catherdral. From here we are *supposed* to be able to just google things to find a Twitter account, but apparently it got nuked in SEO. We are then given the account, which contains 2/3 of the flag, partially encoded in Base64. From this point on a coach just spoon fed us the result, so we didn't really get to work on the challenge. We were supposed to find the location of a statue and submit the name of the city as the last part of the flag.
